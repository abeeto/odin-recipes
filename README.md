# First Odin Project: Recipes

## Overview:
The first odin project is really a test on git commits and setting up HTML files. This simple webpage will hold info about food recipes.

## Key takeaways:
- using terminal for moving files around is very useful
- setting up git for commit messages using a template and opening it using editors like emacs is awesome!
- much easier to set up routing on a static html webpage than with single page webapp using framework like React.
